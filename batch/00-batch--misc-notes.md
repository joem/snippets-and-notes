# Misc Batch Notes


Don't show all the prompts and all the commands as they're executing:
  Put `@ECHO OFF` at the beginning of the batch file.

`nul` is the batch equivalent of a posix system's `/dev/null`

Line continuation:
  End a line with ` ^`
(Note: Must be a space before the carot.)
