# Snippets

This is a small collection of notes (mostly about code, but not exclusively) that I felt were worth writing down.
Sometimes because I keep forgetting my preferred method, sometimes because I keep forgetting how to do something, sometimes because it took me a while to find the answer, etc etc...

Feel free to copy it as you please, but note I don't claim any correctness for the notes.
They're probably correct, but if something goes wrong because you used one of these notes, please don't blame me.


Inspiration
-----------

I started this collection of notes after I was dissatisfied with using a 'snippets manager' program.
I've kept such notes in all kinds of places and formats, but eventually settled on my current directory structure with individual notes, when applicable.
Then a few years later, I found two 'TIL' repos (https://github.com/jbranchaud/til and https://github.com/thoughtbot/til) that are somewhat similar, but a bit more organised.
I switched my notes to markdown and put the repo on github, like the 'TIL' ones, and also borrowed a few of the notes... and here we are.
