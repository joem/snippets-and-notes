# Creating a new repo

- In the upper-right corner of any page, click `+`, and then click `New repository`.
- Give the repo a short, memorable name.
- Add a brief description.
- Don't create a readme or license if you're planning to add an existing repo, since it could cause a merge conflict.
- Click `Create repository`.
- On the next page, it'll tell you how to add an existing repo, or how to initialize a new one.
